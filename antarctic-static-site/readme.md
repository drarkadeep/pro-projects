### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

1. Open `config.yaml` in a text editor.
2. Modify the settings to match your preferences:
   - `site_name`: Your website's name
   - `description`: A brief description of your site
   - `author`: Your name or pseudonym
   - `url`: Your website's URL
   - `posts_per_page`: Number of posts to display per page (default: 10)

### Creating Content

#### Creating a New Post

1. Run the following command:

   ```
   python new_content.py post
   ```

2. Enter the post title when prompted.
3. A new Markdown file will be created in the `content/posts` directory with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
4. Open the file and add your content below the YAML front matter.

#### Creating a New Page

1. Run the following command:

   ```
   python new_content.py page
   ```

2. Enter the page title when prompted.
3. A new Markdown file will be created in the `content/pages` directory.
4. Open the file and add your content below the YAML front matter.

#### YAML Front Matter

The YAML front matter at the top of each content file allows you to specify metadata:

```yaml
---
title: Your Post Title
date: 2023-04-14
categories: [Technology, Programming]
tags: [python, web development]
---
```

### Customizing Templates

Templates are located in the `templates` directory. You can modify these HTML files to change the structure and appearance of your site:

- `base.html`: The main template that all other templates extend
- `post_list.html`: Template for the post listing (homepage)
- `post.html`: Template for individual post pages
- `page.html`: Template for static pages
- `category.html`: Template for category pages
- `tag.html`: Template for tag pages

### Styling Your Site

To customize the look of your site, edit the `static/css/style.css` file. The current theme uses a soft, monochrome design with royal purple as the accent color.

### Generating Your Site

To generate your static site, run:

```
python main.py
```

This will create an `output` directory containing your generated static site.

### Previewing Your Site

To preview your site locally:

1. Navigate to the `output` directory in your terminal/command prompt.
2. Run a local server:

   ```
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`

### Deploying Your Site

The generated static site in the `output` directory can be deployed to any static site hosting service, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

## Additional Features

### RSS Feed

An RSS feed is automatically generated at `output/feed.xml`.

### Sitemap

A sitemap is automatically generated at `output/sitemap.xml`.

### Image Optimization

Images placed in the `static/images` directory are automatically optimized during the build process.

### Code Syntax Highlighting

Use fenced code blocks in your Markdown files to enable syntax highlighting:

    ```python
    def hello_world():
        print("Hello, World!")
    ```

### Automatic Table of Contents

For long posts, a table of contents is automatically generated based on the headings in your content.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please check the following:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.
2. Check that your content files have the correct YAML front matter.
3. Verify that your `config.yaml` file is properly formatted.

If problems persist, please open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.
