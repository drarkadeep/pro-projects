# pro-projects

- Unlike the other repo named "Projects", the ones in this repo are "Pro".
- You can interpret that in two ways -
  - These are "pro" as in primitive
  - These are "pro" as in professional
- As to which pro is this pro, debates are still raging with no conclusion in sight. 
- You can visit the [repo on Github](https://github.com/drarkadeep/pro-projects) to decide for yourself
- Inside each folder you shall find documentation ranging from unnecessarily excessive to absolutely nothing.

***

- BTW, I must admit, these are mostly in python where as the [other repo](https://github.com/drarkadeep/projects) is mostly standalone webapps (with the word "mostly" doing the heavylifting mostly (mostly like this last "mostly" (not the last "mostly", I mostly meant the one before that (but I think you mostly get the idea)))).
