# pro -projects

- Unlike the other repo named "Projects", the ones in this repo are "Pro".
- You can interpret that in two ways -
  - These are "pro" as in primitive
  - These are "pro" as in professional
- As to which pro is this pro, debates are still raging with no conclusion in sight. 
- You can visit the [repo on Github](https://github.com/drarkadeep/pro-projects) to decide for yourself
- Inside each folder you shall find documentation ranging from unnecessarily excessive to absolutely nothing.
